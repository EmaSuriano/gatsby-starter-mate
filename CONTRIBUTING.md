# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Gatsby Mate Starter. With the help of all the contributors this starter is always up to date and free of bugs, resulting in a better application for everybody 😄

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue,
assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate/issues?q=something) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and make one!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork Gatsby Starter Mate](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

The name of the branch must start with the type of the pull request, followed with a short description of what it's trying to achieve.

```
feat  - A new feature.
fix   - A bug fix.
docs  - Documentation only changes
```

Example: `feat/new-top-bar` or `fix/broken-project-link`

## Setting Up the Code for Local Development

1. Fork the `gatsby-mate-starter` repo on GitHub.
2. Create a branch for local development::

```bash
  $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

3. Install dependencies

```
  $ yarn
```

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

```bash
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
  $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

After the pull request is submitted TravisCI is going to run all the automated tasks that ensure a minimum code quality. **This is a mandatory requirement in order to merge your pull request.**
